With a click on the button "Create Screenshot" a screenshot of the main screen is created. This screenshot is then uploaded to imgur.com. After the screenshot has been uploaded successfully, the link of the screenshot is saved to the clipboard. On the right side of the program there is a history of all created screenshots.
